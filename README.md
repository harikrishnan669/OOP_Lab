# Questions

1. Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty
method named numberOfSides( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and
Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the class-
es contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the giv-
en geometrical structures.

2. Write a Java program that implements the binary search algorithm.
  
3. Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator. Arrange Buttons for digits and
the + - * % operations properly. Add a text field to display the result. Handle any possible
exceptions like divide by zero. Use Java Swing.

7. Sample program to create an object of the class.
8. Write a Java program for the following: 
(i) Create a doubly linked list of elements.
(ii) Delete a given element from the above list.
(iii) Display the contents of the list after deletion.
9. Write a Java program that shows the usage of try, catch, throws and finally.
10. Write a Java Program to find the frequency of a given character in a string (without user input).
11. Write a Java Program to find the frequency of a given character in a string (with user input).
12. Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following
members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'print-
Salary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager'
inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'spe-
cialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address
and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and
print the same.

17. Write a Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not ( for numbers ).
18. Sample program to concatenate two strings.
19. A sample java program to calculate sum and average of numbers.
20. Write a Java program that shows thread synchronization.
21. Write a Java program that simulates a traffic light. The program lets the user select one of
three lights: red, yellow, or green. When a radio button is selected, the light is turned on,
and only one light can be on at a time. No light is on when the program starts.
